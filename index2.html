        <h2>Business Overview</h2>
        <p id="mc1" >
            Most companies, over the years, continue to remain unrecognizable while others are forgotten
            to have ever existed. As life expectancies of some companies continue to shrink, together with
            new ones being
            set-up, there is a need for organizations to be vigilant than ever in remaining innovative and
            future-proofing
            in today’s competitive business world. The ability of businesses to overcome the already
            existing competitions
            they face paves a way for them to remain in the market and thereby provide on their missions.
